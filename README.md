This project is assembled with webpack, to run the dev server locally you will have to follow these steps:

1) Install node using [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version (LTS or latest) is not important.

   after the installation check if it was successfull with `node -v` and `npm -v` commands in your terminal or command line
   
2) Download this repo with `git clone` or as a ZIP archive (using git clone may require installation of dev tools on macOS)

3) Use your terminal or command line application to navigate to the directory and execute the following commands

   * `npm install`
   * `npm run build`
   * press CTRL + C to stop watching process or open second window to run next command
   * `npm start`
   
   This should open the website in a separate default browser tab.
